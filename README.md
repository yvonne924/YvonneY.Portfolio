## About
Hi, my name is Yeung Lai, but you can call me Yvonne. I'm originally from Hong Kong and moved to Japan in 2022. Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Information Technology at Kyoto, where I’m focusing on business data science. With over five years of experience in marketing and production, I have honed a results-oriented approach to achieving business goals.

I’ve developed technical expertise in machine learning algorithms, Python, and data visualization through academic projects and my role as a teaching assistant. Additionally, my proven cross-cultural communication skills were demonstrated through translation work with Shiseido, highlighting my ability to adapt to diverse environments.

I combine my marketing experience—understanding business objectives and customer needs—with technical proficiency in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. I am excited about exploring new opportunities where I can leverage my blend of marketing insights and data science expertise to drive business performance. I’m open to new challenges and welcome opportunities to relocate for the right role.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
