## About
Hi, my name is Yeung Lai, but you can call me Yvonne. I'm originally from Hong Kong and moved to Japan in 2022. Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Information Technology at Kyoto, where I’m focusing on business data science. With over five years of experience in marketing and production, I have honed a results-oriented approach to achieving business goals.

I’ve developed technical expertise in machine learning algorithms, Python, and data visualization through academic projects and my role as a teaching assistant. Additionally, my proven cross-cultural communication skills were demonstrated through translation work with Shiseido, highlighting my ability to adapt to diverse environments.

I combine my marketing experience—understanding business objectives and customer needs—with technical proficiency in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. I am excited about exploring new opportunities where I can leverage my blend of marketing insights and data science expertise to drive business performance. I’m open to new challenges and welcome opportunities to relocate for the right role.
